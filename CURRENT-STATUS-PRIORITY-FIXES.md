# ðŸŽ¯ CURRENT STATUS & PRIORITY FIXES

## ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE ISSUES BLOCKING PROGRESS

### 1. **Build System Breakdown**
- **Problem**: Shared package not building to `dist/` folder
- **Impact**: Server cannot import from `@havoc-speedway/shared`
- **Root Cause**: TypeScript compilation failing silently
- **Evidence**: `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` exists but no `dist/` folder

### 2. **Import Path Mismatches**
- **Problem**: Server files mixing old relative imports with new package imports
- **Files Affected**: `CardDeck.ts`, `GameServer.ts`, `MessageHandler.ts`
- **Status**: Partially fixed but build still fails

### 3. **Type System Issues**
- **Problem**: 50+ TypeScript errors due to unknown types, missing Player imports
- **Impact**: Cannot build server, blocks all testing
- **Areas**: `StageManager.ts`, `GameServer.ts`, `MessageHandler.ts`
