## 🎯 Current Implementation Status

**🎮 DEALER SELECTION STAGE - COMPLETE ✅**

The dealer selection stage is now fully implemented and functional:

1. **Start the servers:**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Server
   cd "f:\Havoc-Speedway/server" && npm run dev

   # Terminal 2 - Client  
   cd "f:\Havoc-Speedway/client" && npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test the game:**
   - Open http://localhost:3000 in browser
   - Connect to server
   - Enter your name and create a room
   - Add test players (2-4 total players)
   - Click "Start Game"
   - View dealer selection results

**🔍 What's Working:**
- ✅ Full card deck (32 Storm Rules cards: 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A)
- ✅ Automatic card dealing to all players
- ✅ Highest card wins dealer selection
- ✅ Automatic tie-breaking with new cards
- ✅ Real-time UI updates showing all dealt cards
- ✅ Dealer result announcement
- ✅ Room management and player slots
- ✅ WebSocket communication working perfectly
